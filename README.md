# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple web-based game where players guess a secret number between 1 and 100. Players have 10 attempts to guess the correct number. If they succeed, they win the game. If they run out of attempts, the game is over.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game interface will be displayed, and you can start guessing numbers.

## How to Play

1. Enter your guess into the input field and click the "Submit guess" button.
2. You will receive feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
3. Keep guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
4. After the game ends, you can start a new game by clicking the "Start new game" button.

## Features

- Randomly generated secret number between 1 and 100.
